    content="Through my experience and training at BCIT, I’ve developed a problem-solving mindset rooted in structure and speed. <br><br>I thrive in environments where I can keep learning, contribute meaningfully, and work alongside people who care about doing things right. I’ve supported environments with 600+ users, managed everything from user management to delivering tech events and live streams. <br><br>Whether I’m resolving a technical issue or helping someone feel more confident using their tools, my focus is always on providing thoughtful, reliable support — the kind of support I’d want to receive. I’m looking to grow with a team that values curiosity, communication, and the power of well-run systems"
